# RECOGNIZING MASKED FACES USING Single Shot Detectors (SSD) and CNN

Using the pretrained [OpenCVâ€™s deep learning](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d2/d58/tutorial_table_of_content_dnn.html) face detector which is based on the [Single Shot Detector (SSD)](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/02/26/face-detection-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/#download-the-code) framework with a [ResNet](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-and-coding-a-resnet-in-keras-446d7ff84d33) base network and [CNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn) + Binary Classifier trained on [RMFD](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset) dataset, the program identifies whether people are wearing a mask.
